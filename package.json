  "description": "bar files are a replacement for tar, tar.gz, zip file format. We say that is \"Brick based\" because the storage of files in the archive is based on the concept of a \"brick\". A brick is a buffer of limited length (typical less then 100KB). A small file is represented with a brick but a larger file is represented as a set of bricks. The bar archive has a header that keeps the relation between files and bricks. A brick is identified by its hash (SHA2).",
